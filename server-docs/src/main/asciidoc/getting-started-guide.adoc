= Introduction

OpenPrice API is a RESTful web service for managing user data and user's receipt data.
It uses hypermedia to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

== Running the service
OpenPrice RESTful API is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

We have DEV environment for front-end developer to use for their Web and mobile app development.
The entry point is at `http://54.68.144.235/api`.

You can build and deploy OpenPrice RESTful API Server in Amazon Cloud by following
[Build and Run Backend Server in AWS](https://bitbucket.org/groundtruthinc/openpriceproj/wiki/Build%20and%20Run%20Backend%20Server%20in%20AWS)

Or you can follow the instruction at openpriceproj repository in Bitbucket to setup a local running server.
See [Developer Guide](https://bitbucket.org/groundtruthinc/openpriceproj/wiki/DeveloperGuide)
You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.
