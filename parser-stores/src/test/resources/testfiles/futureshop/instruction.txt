Ignore receipts with 

1. no items
2. hand written receipts
3. parking receipts. 
4. coupons. 

For each receipt to clean, the priority to clean is
1. Store name is important: make sure store name is fixed. For example "fufureshop", please correct it to "futureshop". 
2. Branch info is not important: do not have to clean the branch info like phone number, street address, GST number, etc. 
3. The word "Total" and Total amount is important. Make sure the dot "." in the decimal is not missing. 
4. Date and Time is important. Make sure the date time is correct format as in the receipt.  
4. Prices matters more than the names. 
5. Fix obvious typos in the names. 

In short, clean these:
1. store name
2. total amount
3. Time 
4. Prices
5. Names.
